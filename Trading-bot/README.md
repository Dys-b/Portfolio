#Risk Disclaimer:

It's important to highlight that the developed trading bot may be exposed to financial risks and there's a possibility that the executed trades could result in financial losses. Financial markets are inherently volatile and can change rapidly due to a range of factors, including economic events, geopolitical shifts, and other unpredictable influences.

While diligent effort has been put into developing and training the bot using analysis techniques and Deep Learning models, it's important to understand that no trading system is exempt from risks. Users are strongly advised to fully comprehend the risks involved and consult with financial professionals before making any decisions based on the bot's trades.

Implementing risk management measures, such as setting investment limits and using stop-loss, may be crucial in minimizing the risk of substantial losses. The information provided in this project is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as financial or investment advice.

Please remember that the past performance of any trading strategy doesn't guarantee future results and it's important to be prepared to absorb potential losses while engaging in financial trades."**
